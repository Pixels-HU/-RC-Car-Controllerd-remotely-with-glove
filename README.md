# RC-Car-Controllerd-remotely-with-glove


Description:
Our project can be divided into two parts:
The first part is the glove that is used to read the difference in x-axis and y-axis in order to determine the direction 
The second part is the robot car that delivers the signal from the glove and move in the direction which is determined by the glove 
So that the car direction can be changed by changed the glove direction
